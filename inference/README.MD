## Inference

To run a model against a video, open the inference.py or inference2.py script and modify the relavent parameters such as video name and model location.

If you do not have the models directory cloned in your computer, or setup in your `PYTHONPATH`, run `inference2.py`. If you so then run `inference.py`. Make sure you add the `models/research/object_detection` directory to your `PYTHONPATH` as well.
